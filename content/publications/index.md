### Saline Solution Based Miniaturized Low-Frequency Dipole for UAV based River Monitoring Systems

<div align="justify">
Developed a novel minimization technique to incorporate saline solution as a core material with low
frequency wire antenna's to efficiently reduce their overall electrical length. This implementation results in a size
reduction of 47%. Used tools like Ansys HFSS, MATLAB to simulate, mathematically model and optimize this
miniaturization technique to result in a return loss of around -50dB and an overall bandwidth enhancement of 53%.
